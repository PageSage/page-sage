# AuthN Pages #

The files here are for HTML/Jinja2 templates relating to AuthN.


## `choose-login.html` ##
* This file acts as an alternative login page with choices to login with different OAuth2 credentials

## `google-login.html` ##
* This file acts as a placeholder in case the traditional google login does not route properly

## `signup.html` ##
* This file is no longer needed as log-in and sign-up function the same now (they access the same routes)
